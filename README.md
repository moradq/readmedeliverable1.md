Date | Semester Milestone | Project Milestone
---|---|---|
*Sun, 09 12* | **Deliverable 1:** New Learning | Pick a project on what you want to do with specifics. These specifics being to pick the type of project I want to do, how I'm planning on doing it with a time line and learning plan that I took some time to make, look for and research different courses and sources for my project whether it's to either gather information or to start learning, then finally, start working on my project after picking my API. I'm planning on doing a mask detection robot which gives a certain command based on if someone is or isn't wearing a mask then putting a warning on a message board. Other part of the plan is for when I finish the first part.
*Sun, 09 26* | **Deliverable 2:** New Learning | Start learning and developing some scraps of different coding languages after finding a suitable course to learn the language that I intend to do the project in. (In this case it's Python). Then finally start working on and developing my skills in Python and finalize my choice for the API and commit to the learning.
*Sun, 10 10* | **Deliverable 3:** Project Foundation |

# Deliverible Two New Learning

For ths assignment, I'm told to show what I have learned so far as "new" learning since September 12th all the way 'till the 26th of September. Frankly though, I don't feel like I've learned a lot but I think not learning helps me learn more. Let me explain:

### Reflection So Far
1. My second goal for this specific deliverable is to show any kind of new learning up until the 26th from the 12th. However, there was a small problem. Along with the API, it took me a long time to find a free course for Python. As it may seem, there were many Python courses but they were either behind paywalls or didn't have the units I needed so in short, I did not meet my goal this time though I hope to do so later. My learning plan is very vague so I decided to take the previous feedback and reformat the timeline with more specific examples and goals. This is the feedback that I got in between the 12th and 26th:
- Start exploring more options and researching different websites and courses then compile them and decide.
- Compare and contrast the sites on different units of learning and such.
- Use certain sources and comments to tell the legitimacy of a website.

2. I'd like to think that even if I was nowhere near my initial goal achievement, I learned a lot. It's true that this may sound like I'm contradicting myself but hear me out. Through the time I've been in this class, I've noticed that I procrastinate a lot and make excuses but I feel like I finally learned my lesson to certain extents. Not learning and realizing my mishaps and failures made me learn even more than ever because of my inaction. My goal wasn't met but I learned a lot about how I both function and work at certain times and began to adapt myself to this new change I'm seeing. Here's how:
- I started taking notes about different things that distracted me.
- Made a schedule on the times that I predict I can and can't work from distractions or not being able to sit in one place for too long.
- Take certain precautions in order to not distract myself.
- Limit free time I have as 5 minutes between 30 minutes of work.
- Don't take anything too seriously as it would act as extra work for me in the long run.
- Have a lot of fun while working!

3.  I believe that, to stay on schedule, I have to get some help from Mr. Bowman as well as help from the other Computer Coding 2 students, start researching more about my project and learn some programming for the language that I decided to use at home for at least 45 minutes a day and maybe more during the weekend, and finally, make all the adjustments necessary to fix up my plan and change it up along the way just in case. I had also thought about asking outside sources for help on a public forum and getting well thought-out answers will drive me to become more motivated and responsible.

4.  What I did for new learning is learned more about myself and how I finish tasks at certain intervals along with how I pace myself. Later on, I'd like to talk to Mr. Bowman about learning and Python course options if they ever arise soon. Since I learned how to fix up my schedule, I can surmise that I can start getting to work as soon as possible, after reading up on some facts, I would be way more productive if I work 30-35 minutes then take breas at different 5 minute intervals after the productive time, I will be able to get a lot done.

# Deliverible One Repo

For ths assignment, I'm told to show what I had worked on since the first day in class as a deliverable to present. I called this file "Deliverable One" but I'm not sure if we will use this same file for the other deliverables that we are tasked with. This is what I have so far.

### Reflection So Far
1. My first goal for the deliverable was that I wanted to show my initial knowledge of the programming language that I will most likely use for my programming project. At first, Mr. Bowman thought it was vague which, when brought up to me, concured with after I was given an example of what I should do better and was given this feedback:
- Be more specific on which language I want to learn while doing the project.
- Instead of jumping straight to languages and learning programming, I should do some research on the face recognition API.
- Don't just think about languages but instead, also think of deadlines and if I will have time to learn the language.
- Make my project a bit smaller and better to view as something that isn't so complicated and outlandish so it doesn't take more time than the semester I signed up for.
- Finish one thing THEN think about the other without overthinking ideas or underestimating their difficulty.
- Have fun with it!

2. I'd like to think that even if I was nowhere near my initial goal achievement, I still got amazing feedback. The reason I wasn't able to achieve my goal was because it was too general and didn't make too much sense after reading it out loud and thinking about it. From the feedback above, I would like to improve and work on all of these before the next deliverable by makinga plan and getting some more criticism from peers so I can finally organize myself well enough.

3.  I believe that, to stay on schedule, I have to get some help from Mr. Bowman as well as help from the other Computer Coding 2 students, start researching more about my project and learn some programming for the language that I decided to use at home for at least 45 minutes a day and maybe more during the weekend, and finally, make all the adjustments necessary to fix up my plan and change it up along the way just in case.
