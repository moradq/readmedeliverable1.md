# Deliverible One Repo

For ths assignment, I'm told to show what I had worked on since the first day in class as a deliverable to present. I called this file "Deliverable One" but I'm not sure if we will use this same file for the other deliverables that we are tasked with. This is what I have so far.

### Final Commentary on My Computer
1. My first goal for the deliverable was that I wanted to show my initial knowledge of the programming language that I will most likely use for my programming project. At first, Mr. Bowman thought it was vague which, when brought up to me, concured with after I was given an example of what I should do better and was given this feedback:
- Be more specific on which language I want to learn while doing the project.
- Instead of jumping straight to languages and learning programming, I should do some research on the face recognition API.
- Don't just think about languages but instead, also think of deadlines and if I will have time to learn the language.
- Make my project a bit smaller and better to view as something that isn't so complicated and outlandish so it doesn't take more time than the semester I signed up for.
- Finish one thing THEN think about the other without overthinking ideas or underestimating their difficulty.
- Have fun with it!

2. I'd like to think that even if I was nowhere near my initial goal achievement, I still got amazing feedback. The reason I wasn't able to achieve my goal was because it was too general and didn't make too much sense after reading it out loud and thinking about it. From the feedback above, I would like to improve and work on all of these before the next deliverable by makinga plan and getting some more criticism from peers so I can finally organize myself well enough.

3.  I believe that, to stay on schedule, I have to get some help from Mr. Bowman as well as help from the other Computer Coding 2 students, start researching more about my project and learn some programming for the language that I decided to use at home for at least 45 minutes a day and maybe more during the weekend, and finally, make all the adjustments necessary to fix up my plan and change it up along the way just in case.
